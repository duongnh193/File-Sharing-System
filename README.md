4. P2P Network Functions
connectToPeer(peerId): Establish a connection with a peer node.
disconnectFromPeer(peerId): End a connection with a peer node.
broadcastFileAvailability(fileId): Notify peers of a fileâ€™s availability for sharing.
requestFileFromPeer(fileId, peerId): Request a file directly from a peer node.
managePeerConnections(): Monitor and manage active connections with peers.
syncFilesWithPeers(): Synchronize file lists with peers to maintain consistency.
5. Data Integrity & Consistency
computeFileHash(fileId): Generate a hash to verify file integrity.
verifyFileIntegrity(fileId, hash): Check file integrity against stored hash.
resolveFileConflicts(fileId, conflictingFile): Handle conflicts if multiple versions of a file exist.
backupFile(fileId): Backup file in case of corruption or accidental deletion.
6. Notification System
notifyUser(message, userId): Send notifications to users (e.g., file download completion, new share).
broadcastUpdateNotification(fileId): Notify peers about an update to a shared file.
receiveNotifications(): Retrieve notifications and display to the user.
7. Logging and Monitoring
logFileAccess(fileId, userId): Record access events for files.
logPeerConnection(peerId): Track connections made with peers.
generateActivityReport(): Generate a report of user activities and file sharing actions.
monitorSystemHealth(): Monitor the overall health of the network and connected nodes.
8. Admin Functions
manageUsers(): Admin functionality to view and manage users.
viewAllFiles(): Admin function to view all files in the system.
enforceDataQuota(userId): Limit users' storage capacity as per set quotas.
auditFileSharing(): Track and review file-sharing activities for security compliance.
9. Security Functions

decryptFile(fileId, decryptionKey): Decrypt an encrypted file upon access.
setFilePermission(fileId, userId, permissionLevel): Define access levels (read, write, execute) for users.
auditAccessLogs(): Regularly review access logs for suspicious activities.
10. User Interface Functions
displayFileList(): Display available files to the user.
showFileDetails(fileId): Show detailed information for a selected file.
promptUser(message): Show prompts for actions (e.g., download, share).
displayNotifications(): Show user notifications.
Each of these functions should support the P2P architecture, ensuring decentralized management and easy scalability.
